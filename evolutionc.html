<div class="p">
Countless forces in nature have worked together to create a being that can rise above itself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Once, man’s survival and development, faced with an extremely challenging environment depended on instinct and intuition. Humankind were significantly instinctual group-animals and lived in an animistic psychic state of oneness with nature. They lived to a high degree by knowledge, morality, and behaviour patterns provided by their innate nature.
<br>
<br>
Complex autonomous thinking, with its ability to problem-solving and planning ahead, was still to come.

That developed when early humans needed broader orientation of their environment and planning strategies and devising tools to defend them against destructive forces of nature and enemies; and solve conflict and problems in their expanding societies.
<br>
<br>
Under these pressures of increasingly complex and demanding social environments, we modern humans have for good part left behind the instinctual way of navigating life.  

We have developed, a degree of consciousness of our actions and a mind and will of our own. We have attained objective, critical thinking and knowledge of reality. A degree of discipline and insight into our selves keeps us most of the time safe from our blind impulses and potential dangers of reality.
<br>
<br>
Increased free will and mental flexibility enable us to make our own choices and plan our future. Our field of consciousness of reality has expanded and continues to do so. We now can navigate our environment with a fair degree of autonomy. We have impressive associative and logical sequential thinking, as man’s achievements in science and technology shows.

We have developed a sense of morality, a notion of protecting our well-being and not harming each other. This ability translated into a code of conduct, a collection of laws that prevents moral decay and provides us with social justice, to which all group members have to abide.
<br>
<br>
But the darker aspects of our social life and the damaging effects we have onto others and our natural living environment show, that we certainly are not sufficiently ethically human. We lack more in-depth insight in and are often ignorant of the forces that can negatively impact our lives and others. The collective moral code of conduct is not enough to keep us safe from harming ourselves and others. We have much more development to do in this respect.

We have to add to our capacity for reason, a broader conscious light and attain knowledge of our outer and inner reality. In particular of our psyche’s unconscious part, including the collective Unconscious (or innate spirit of nature) we all partake in.
<br>
<br>
Insufficient self-knowledge (of the ego-conscious+the unconscious part of the psyche) is the main reason that we still are morally deficient. We need more knowledge of our full nature and become more conscious of the consequences of our actions. Attainment of broader insight in our psychic nature will become personal duty and task for all people in the future .

Observing the plight of our natural environment, general moral decay and inhuman aspects of societies, it is clear that we suffer from this lack of insight into our nature and we can observe that we are still poor in ethical ability.

We need a much more differentiated and mature feeling-relation to others and nature, enabling us to reason and navigate life by feeling-valuation, and priority in feeling-order. And perceive life and broader reality in the correct image and moral order and truly humanise the world.

Biological evolution by the Darwinist process and genetic -‘ chance?’ – mutations have made us physical vessels in which content of spiritual /of unknown origin, can be expressed and come to realization within the human psyche and will determine our further evolution, our ongoing humanization.
<br>
<br>
How will personal psychological development and general human evolution make mature ethical beings out of us and by that fully human?
<br>
<br>


[ In development…..
<br>

The subjective and objective psyche…
<br>
<br>

The rise of the ego-complex ; Loss of instinct—guidance by innate nature.

Separated from the instinctual base by an ego—that thinks it’s the only King/Queen in the castle of the Self and rules over nature
<br>
<br>

Return to the broader Self / the Unconscious or the Spirit of nature within, with a conscious and objective mind.
<br>
<br>

Uptake of archetypal content for further humanization of man.
<br>

The long brutal way of biological evolution made the human organism into a vessel for the uptake of so-called archetypal content, created by innate creative nature/spirit. One can foresee that the existence of archetypes, brought to our rational understanding by C.G.Jung in their aspect of being intrinsic psychic structural elements in the later stages of the evolution of our psyche, will give the materialistic evolutionary psychologists a good headache. Without archetypes, we cannot function as biologically based beings with typical human behaviour and – psychology; and we cannot individuate without taking into account these intra-and endo-psychic factors. Because even the instinct of and process of individuation – becoming a conscious-aware mature human-has an archetypal structure underneath.

We shall have to let go of the idea that only external forces have been involved in the evolution of the human psyche. The same goes for the Freudian notion that the ego-conscious part of the mind has somehow mysteriously created an unconscious with extraordinary abilities that function as a supplement/auxiliary to its functioning. An unconscious that even can produce dreams and intuitions that aid the ego-complex in its development. By which the unconscious part of the human psyche shows that it knows about the state of our ego-conscious reality and its living environment. It can provide the ego with information on how to adapt correctly it’s our outer and inner world, bring the ego in right balance with the broader psyche, and guides us by cultivating the ego to become conscious-aware individuals.
